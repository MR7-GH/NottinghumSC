# Crypto Lottery on TON Blockchain

## Overview

This project is a decentralized online lottery built on the **TON Blockchain** using **TACT language**. The main goal is to ensure complete transparency and fairness, making it impossible for anyone to cheat. Since all transactions and lottery draws are recorded on the blockchain, anyone can verify the results.

## Features

- **Fully Transparent**: Every lottery transaction is recorded on the blockchain, ensuring fairness.
- **Secure & Trustless**: Smart contracts handle the entire lottery process without any central authority.
- **Crypto-based**: Users can participate using TON tokens.
- **Decentralized**: No single entity controls the lottery; everything runs on smart contracts.
- **Verifiable Results**: The winning numbers and payouts can be verified by anyone directly on the blockchain.

## How It Works

1. Users buy lottery tickets by sending TON tokens to the smart contract.
2. The smart contract records all participants and their tickets.
3. At the end of the lottery period, a **provably fair random number** selects the winner.
4. The prize is automatically sent to the winnerâ€™s wallet.
5. All transactions and results remain publicly visible on the blockchain.

## Technology Stack

- **Blockchain**: TON Blockchain
- **Smart Contract Language**: TACT
- **Cryptocurrency Used**: TON (The Open Network)

## Getting Started

To participate or deploy the contract:

1. Install **TON wallet** and fund it with TON tokens.
2. Deploy the smart contract on the TON blockchain.
3. Interact with the contract using blockchain explorers or scripts.

## Verification

All lottery transactions and results can be viewed on the **TON blockchain explorer**, ensuring full transparency.
